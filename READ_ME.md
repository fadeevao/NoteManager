Hi! 

This is the first project I created to learn a bit of Spring and Hibernate in my free time. Also, I wanted to explore integration testing and mocking in a bit more detail. 

This project is a simple web application where a user can create an account, log into it and then start adding notes such as: interesting recipe, reminder about meeting and so on.


For testing  I used MockMVC to test controllers behaviour - end to end test that helped me find lots of flaws in the code. I also used Mockito for mocking out some objects.

The UI is very simple and I have taken some snippets of code and pictures from the internet and then modified then according to my needs. Whenever it's been done, a comment has been made to indicate where the resource comes from. The UI is very simple and would require more testing if the application was ever to be released in public. 

Please note that this is a learning project. 

I think that I've learned a lot by working on it and will be able to setup a Spring project in the future. 


The app was run in Tomcat8 server, dependency management tool used in Maven.  

Cheers!
